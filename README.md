# Seikai-no-Senki-portrait-mod-for-Stellaris
My attempt at a portrait mod for the game Stellaris by Paradox. Adds an elf-like race called the Abh from the anime and novels Seikai no Senki. 
Seems to work in version 1.4.1 of the game.

## To Install 
Place the abh.mod file in: C:\Users\{{Username}}\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\mod and make sure all the other files are in the same diectory in a folder called 'abh'.

Don't forget to enable it in the mods section of the game launcher.
